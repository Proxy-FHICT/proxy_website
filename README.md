# proxy_website
the proxy website redesign assignment. will be made public when ready  

## to get started
the filestructure is horrible,  
but! if you want to try something with the pages,   
the local host should be started in the **root** of the project  

for now just the homepage is under construction, when it will be ready we can consider moving to other pages also

### filestrcuture:  
- `globals` -- some global assets
- `pages` -- the directory where work on the pages is done
- `.` -- nothing for the package.json and other stuff
